- Extended Leave
- Leave w/o pay
- Sabbatical

### Critical Personnel
 -  if you are in one of these roles, you already know it.  Your holidays and time off will be handled differently. Your supervisor or manager will share the details. 


### Holidays and Vacation Time 

* Philosophy on holidays and vacation - because we are a global organization we aim to honor everyone's individual cultural priorities. And we support nurturing your passions and feeding your soul.  At the same time, if we made every National and religious holiday a day off we wouldn't work much, and while we hope it doesn't feel like work, that is why we are here.

### So in order to keep it simple: Everybody starts with the same amount of "leave time"
### * 3 weeks (15 working days) and 5 pre-approved Holidays of your choice. (yep, that's 4 weeks!)  

#### We do not choose your Holidays because we do not all follow the same religious or cultural traditions.

### Honoring Global Tradition

We embrace being a global organization and celebrating all cultures and religions, and individual hallmarks are important to fostering a healthy, inclusive, and empathic work environment. 

> We cannot celebrate everyone's personally cherished holidays in an effort to be universally tolerant though as this would be constant celebration, and we wouldn't get much work done. 

Therefore celebration for specific holidays are welcome and we encourage you to share about your traditions in the Synchronous community.  These celebrations should occur outside of the typical workday of your team.   

#### Plus ${env.company} chooses to honor 3 additional days that we consider worthy of Vacation time.

* #### Founders Day - we hope you will join us for the Company celebration and show Guy, Lisa and Kati your gratitude for their synchronous union!

* #### Veterans Day - we aim to honor and respect veterans around the world who have fought for freedom 

* #### R.A.K. day - Our mission is promoting Kindness.  So everyone is encouraged to take a day for Random Acts of Kindness, a day to be of service to your community.  Use this time to serve at Habitat for Humanity, the homeless Mission, or the local free clinic.   
* This is not a day to sit at home and chill, there are plenty of available days for that.  
 

## Parental Leaves (maternity, paternity & adoption) 

We absolutely support you and taking time off to embrace and adjust a major family change. 

We will start by honoring the laws of the state in which you reside and comply with FMLA requirements.

* 8 weeks paid for birth 
* 6 weeks paid for non-birth parent or adoption
* The remainder of your FMLA term is unpaid but available for use up to one year. 
*  Any arrangements consistent with this policy can be made with their manager and approved by HR. (i.e. remote working, part time hours, etc.)

Should you get selected, we understand you may need to serve. and we will comply with State law, you will not be penalized in any way.


##  Sabbatical Leave

If you have been with the company for more than 5 years you may be eligible for a month or more of a personal and professional growth sabbatical. 

If you have an opportunity to go travel with the Dalai Lama or study Spanish in Spain - then we would consider that a wonderful tool to bring back to the ${env.company} Community. 

While we may not be able to pay you while you're gone we may be able to help cover the cost of your experience and have your job for you when you get back. 

So before you say "no" give us a chance to see if we can embrace the adventure!
