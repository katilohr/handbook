*Sickness and bad things happen to good people. So we hope to provide you with support to be the healthiest you can be.*

The following is a brief description of our benefit program. Upon eligibility, you will receive a more detailed and comprehensive package. 

Any employees consistently working 30 hours or more are eligible to participate in the program upon eligibility.  ${env.company} covers the colleague portion fully and colleagues have option to purchase additional family coverage. Participation in the program is mandatory unless proper documentation is provided detailing involvement in a spouseâ€™s benefit plan. 

Benefit programs are in place for:

- Health Care
- HSA
- Vision
- Dental
- Long Term Disability
- 401K - will be offered as our company becomes more mature

All dental, vision and health forms should be submitted directly to the provider and directly by employees. Any changes to personal data, including dependent information, needs to be communicated promptly to the Controller to avoid interruptions in benefit involvement.

### Everyone Must Comply

Not only because our benefits providers require it but also because we genuinely want people to be happy and healthy. We are not going to help you avoid the system just because you think you are bullet-proof or luckier than other people.

Everybody gets sick. Everybody has issues. We want everyone to be protected.
